This is a Mock commerce application I'm developing to advance my Android-Kotlin skills. 

I'm using

Fragment+Viewmodel for persistence across state changes.

Livedata for passing for consumers.

Jetpack Navigation for handling navigation.

Okhttp3 for network calls. Some files images etc are on github repository and I'm requesting them to create a good interface instead of using local resources.

Glide for image loading

Koin for DSL, I have used Dagger2 but it seemed to complicated for such projects. If we were talking about multi million line java enterprise application it is fine but for android Koin is good.

Timber for logging.

Gson for de/serialization
